Hello World!

This is August 17th 2018.

It is cloudy with a chance of Thunderstorms outside.

I am doing this right after my daily standup.

Shriya brought my lunch plate

This is 07th Sep.

Shriya is lying on the sofa doing chutu chutu and Suchita is on the phone with somone for cake order.
I have successfully pulled this readme on my git server from github and now I am editing this on the command line
